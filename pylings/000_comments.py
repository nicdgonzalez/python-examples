# It is great practice to use comments to help readers (or your future self)
# understand the codebase better and to avoid silly bugs.

# Comments are lines that start with a hash (#), and they are ignored by
# the interpreter at runtime. You can write whatever you'd like in comments.

# Comments can either be on their own line, or at the end of a line of code.
